## Notes

It is important to clarify this project's two distinct uses of AI. The core scientific methodology uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the 2D Burgers' equation. Separately, generative AI (GenAI) tools were used as a complementary resource to accelerate the literature review, assist in selecting articles, and optimize code. All GenAI-assisted outputs, including article selections, were subject to rigorous human review, critical analysis, and final validation to ensure accuracy and authorship. Furthermore, care was taken to prevent the sharing of sensitive or unpublished research data with third-party AI services.
